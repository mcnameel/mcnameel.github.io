<b>I found this statement really profound for whatever lame reason,
        "That other piece of code you’ve been using for years—it couldn’t possibly still have a bug in it. Could it? Of course it can.
        The amount of surprise you feel when something goes wrong is directly proportional to the amount of trust and faith you have
        in the code being run"
  For some reason I really was able to imagine myself doing this. I could, after using the same code for five years go back and just
  realize "oh s***", this is completely insecure.

  Another thing that I really liked and related to was, "A surprising number of people we’ve met use the Windows notepad
utility to edit their source code. This is like using a teaspoon as a shovel—simply..." I know people like this... the people who
needlessly overcomplicate their lives by using 'simplicity' as the excuse.</b>
