Blog #1 - What does software engineering mean to me?

I obviously cannot provide a great definition for this 
since I have very little experience with the topic. 
Nonetheless, I can apply the minimal experience I 
possess to form an adequate approximation of the term.
I feel that software engineering is a very apt name 
for the design process of a program because it 
connotes the extreme care and meticulous precision 
by which a programmer must develop a functional 
program. To me, Software Engineering means looking at 
the problem the program aims to solve or the purpose 
the program is to serve in a sort of ‘big picture’ 
fashion. Then, outlining a solution, choosing the best 
implementation of the solution step by step, and then 
of course testing along the way at each step.
