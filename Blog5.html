<h2>12 Factor Methodology</h2>
<p>I find this interesting as I actually recently applied to a company which advertised itself as an IBM partner who offered "Maximo as A Service." I do like this concept for certain projects. Like for enterprise security systems, a Software-as-a-Service mentality is clearly the only way to go because in the security system you are selling a service which is a wall against all new and old types of threats. However, there are types of software to which this mentality should only be partially applied. For example, in recent years the launch quality of many types of software, most notably video games, has drastically decreased. When a video game is set to launch it is very likely that the game you play on launch day will already have updates, furthermore the game on launch day is in many cases a drastically different game than it is 2 months later. Most of the time the game is far better two months later. In this case, the developers should take a software as a service mentality but only for the deployment of the game, maintenance of servers and the occasional bug fixing. This is not how the cycle goes, many games are just released even when they are not ready but the companies know that they can update the game until it is truly production ready.<br>

Overall I though the article was good if fairly Borg-like in the presentation of their points: "Sticky sessions are a violation of twelve-factor and should never be used or relied upon [and we will assimilate you for your violation of twelve-factor]."
