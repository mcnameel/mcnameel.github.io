Blog 2 - Chapter 1 Reflection
I like this book. The habbits it is trying to instill into its readers are ones that I have found extremely useful in my own experience with coding. Document heavily and well and if there is a problem fix
 it now so it doesnt become a bigger problem later. This "dont leave broken windows" technique has helped me a lot in the past even if it has meant me spending twice the amount of time on my code as my classmates
 in order to fix something that the professor isn't likely to notice but would plague users who would use the program extensively. Also I have very little experience working on a team so I hadn't thouht about 
 the fact that nobody wants to be the first person to make a mess so if you keep your code clean, your team will likely do the same. <br/>
 I really like the authors emphasis on self educating. I love reading (techniqually listening to audiobooks) because I love learning  new things. I am currently reading the book 1776 by David McCullough because
 I became interested in American history recently. I Love learning. Heck I programmed a simple GUI into my hello world project because I wanted to learn how to program a GUI.
